Solar Panel Inspection using CNN
Overview
This project focuses on detecting and inspecting solar panels using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is designed to identify defects, classify panel conditions, and enhance maintenance efficiency.

Dataset
Source: Google Images (for now), with plans to integrate satellite imagery in the future.
Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Model Architecture
Base Model: VGG16 (pretrained on ImageNet).
Modifications:
Removed fully connected layers.
Added custom classification layers.
Fine-tuned specific layers to adapt to solar panel inspection.

Training & Evaluation
Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
Optimizer: Adam
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall
Training Tools: TensorFlow/Keras in Google Colab

Results
Achieved [92.7 %] on test data.
Successfully identified [types of defects-snowdrop,bird drop,sand dust etc].

Future Work
Integrate satellite imagery for large-scale analysis.
Experiment with transformer-based models (e.g., ViTs, Swin Transformer).
Deploy as a web app for real-time inspections.
